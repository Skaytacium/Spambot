# Spambot

## The most elegant discord.js based spambot written in TypeScript

### IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This is only for educational purposes and should not be used for accounts. If you want to use it, go ahead and make a bot in the Discord API, log into to it and do stuff with it. Using it for personal accounts is against the Terms of Service and can get you banned. No warranty or liability is offered with this piece of software

Pretty self explanatory. Can compile with Babel (to compile with this, uncomment allowJs, noEmit and moduleResolution).

Lots of features, TODO includes better README but I will probably make someone else do that.

For now you can use --help while running it to see the parameters.

Once started, you can also run `help` to see the available commands, except exit, they do nothing.

TODO is pretty big, might add it to README, but if you want to know the TODO, check commit messages for now.
