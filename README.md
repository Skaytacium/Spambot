# Spambot

## The most elegant and powerful discord.js based spambot written in TypeScript

### Requirements

- Node.js

### Description

The most powerful and elegant discord.js spambot. It has features ranging from simple single message spamming to complex multi-message and multi-timing spamming. Yes, I did waste 1 week of my life making this. Written in TypeScript and has a decent amount of @ts-ignores but those are justifiable if you look where they are placed.

### Get started

2. Change into the directory and open a shell.
3. Run `npm` or `yarn` depending on which one you use.
4. How to compile to javascript:
    - npm users: `npx babel src -d build -x .ts`
    - yarn users: `yarn babel src -d build -x .ts`
5. Run `node build --help` to get started or look [HELP.md](here) *TODO*
